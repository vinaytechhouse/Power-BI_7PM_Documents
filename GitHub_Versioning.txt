Versioning

Maintaining multiple copies of the same document with multiple changes is called as versioning.
In real time all organizations implement this as part of documents storing and keep tracking of changes.

Micorosft applications frequently used versioning tools

a) TFS [Team Foundation Server]

b) Git Hub

c) VSS [Visual Source Safe]


Third Party

PVCS 
SubVersion
etc...


GitHub
======
Source code build, control and version maintenance service.

Here we create a repository and all documents store under repository master branch.
Versioning maintained in that branch only.

In case any doc change required, create a child branch, take documents, download them.
Work on  the documents, place in the child branch.

Later merge the child branch documents with parent branch [master].

Remove the child branch after operations.

Now the master havig multiple versions for the documents in the repository.




GitHub Versioning

We create repository which is like a folder, it has main branch with all the documents.
This main branch only store history of changes.
 

a) If you are confident about document you are uploading, directly do it in the master.
    So that that document versioning maintained.
   Incase you are not confident / most of the IT companies not allowing directly to maintain versioning. So, we need to follow the below process.
 1. Create a branch called Test
 2. Upload the modified document
 3. Create a pull request
 4. Merge the pulled request
 5. Automatically Test branch will be deleted.

Note: This versioning is close to TFS [Team Foundation Server] versioning.
